## Preperation

What hardware needs to do:
- Partitioning of higher level caches.
  [lynx](https://www.lynx.com/blog/what-is-cache-coloring), cache-coloring is
  highly specific to each CPU architecture. Cache coloring generally is very
  complex, and worsens the average case performance.
- Flushable microarchitectural state, lower level caches, TLB and so on.

What OS needs to do:
- Partition the OS. This can be done spatially, such that OS is run in the same
  user domain as the user program calling the OS (Missing OS Abstraction), or it
  can be done temporally, e.g. flushing the OS state after it's execution and
  making the running time deterministic. (Constant time programming and more)
- Constant time context-switching and flushing state on domain switch.
- Keep track of the partitioned higher level caches.
- Constant time interrupts. Same as the partition of the OS.

## What can I do?

- Implementing the above in a Kernel, which did not have this in mind originally. Is this feasible?
- Create a model, which can be used to prove timing channel protection via. the above methods.
